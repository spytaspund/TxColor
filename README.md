# TxColor
TxColor is the python library that provides text color formating.

TxColor gives you the ability to format text with colors right in it! You can also provide a string!

Color tags:

r - red

g - green

B - blue

y - yellow

p - purple

c - cyan

w - white

If you wish to add a txt file, simply do this:

TxColorLib.find(open("txt.txt", "r").read())
or
TxColorLib.find(open("txt.txt", "r"))

At this moment, library contains only ONE (!11!1111) function find()!

Note:
Color tags may update in future! (Because we want to add bg support)

Also special thanks to colorama!
